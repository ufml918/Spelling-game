# Spelly-streak


SPELLY Streak provides teachers a fun and engaging tool for
vocabulary drills. Students can use this tool at the end of a lesson
to check if they
'
ve got all the words taught in class. Teachers
simply need to supply the words and the app will do its magic. In
the game, students decide how many lives they will have. Players
will enter a letter to guess the correct word. If the letter does not
appear in the word, they would lose one life. It'
s an exciting way to
get students to memorize words they
'
ve learned while making sure
they know the right spelling. Students will also become familiar
with ways vowels and consonants appear in words.

# Spelly-match
SPELLY Match is a tool that help teachers creates a minicompetition for language learners. Students would first enter and
confirm their names to initiate the game. We put in several
safeguards to make sure the names they put in are correct. In the
game, players will be given questions in their native language, and
they need to get the correct word and spelling in the target
language to score points. The system will reveal the correct word
and spelling if the players did not get a question right. At the end
of the game, the system will calculate total points received and
award medals based on pre-determined values.
