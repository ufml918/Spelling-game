#Spelly-streak


SPELLY Streak provides teachers a fun and engaging tool for
vocabulary drills. Students can use this tool at the end of a lesson
to check if they
'
ve got all the words taught in class. Teachers
simply need to supply the words and the app will do its magic. In
the game, students decide how many lives they will have. Players
will enter a letter to guess the correct word. If the letter does not
appear in the word, they would lose one life. It'
s an exciting way to
get students to memorize words they
'
ve learned while making sure
they know the right spelling. Students will also become familiar
with ways vowels and consonants appear in words.
